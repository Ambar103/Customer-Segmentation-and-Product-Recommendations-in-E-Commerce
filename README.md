## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip or conda

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ambar103/Customer-Segmentation-and-Product-Recommendations-in-E-Commerce.git
cd Customer-Segmentation-and-Product-Recommendations-in-E-Commerce
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Usage

### Running the Full Pipeline

```python
from src.data_preprocessing import preprocess_data
from src.segmentation import CustomerSegmentation
from src.recommendations import RecommendationEngine

# Load and preprocess data
data = preprocess_data('data/raw/customer_data.csv')

# Customer Segmentation
segmentation = CustomerSegmentation(n_clusters=4)
customer_segments = segmentation.fit_predict(data)

# Product Recommendations
recommender = RecommendationEngine(method='hybrid')
recommendations = recommender.recommend(data, customer_segments)
```

### Jupyter Notebooks

Navigate through the analysis step-by-step:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

Start with `01_data_exploration.ipynb` and follow sequentially.

## 📊 Dataset

### Expected Data Format

**Customer Data**: CSV file with columns
- `customer_id`: Unique customer identifier
- `purchase_history`: Array of product IDs purchased
- `total_spent`: Total monetary value
- `purchase_frequency`: Number of transactions
- `last_purchase_date`: Most recent purchase date
- `demographic_features`: Age, location, etc.

**Product Data**: CSV file with columns
- `product_id`: Unique product identifier
- `category`: Product category
- `price`: Product price
- `attributes`: Product features/specifications

### Sample Data

Sample datasets are provided in `data/sample_data/` for testing and demonstration purposes.

## 🔬 Methodology

### Customer Segmentation

1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling
2. **RFM Analysis**: Calculate Recency, Frequency, Monetary metrics
3. **Clustering**: Apply K-Means algorithm to identify natural customer groups
4. **Profiling**: Characterize each segment with key attributes

### Product Recommendations

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Find similar customers and recommend products they liked
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommend products similar to user's purchase history
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine both methods for optimal results
4. **Ranking**: Score and rank recommendations by relevance

## 📈 Results

Model performance metrics include:
- Silhouette Score for clustering quality
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score for recommendations
- Customer segment characteristics and sizes
- Recommendation coverage and diversity

Detailed results are available in the `results/` directory with visualizations and analytics.
